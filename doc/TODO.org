* Short-Term
** TODO In README, describe how to generate typing data with different settings.
** TODO Put frequency statistics program into Typing GitHub
** TODO Respond to Yarick Antonov's email.
** TODO Set up donations
* Big Changes
** TODO Add unit tests.
** TODO Add convergence hacks to the multithreaded algorithm.
** TODO Make it easier to change the keys on a keyboard (i.e. for other languages).
** TODO Make it easier to add new physical keyboard types.
** TODO Implement WalkSat http://mathematicalmulticore.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/introducing-the-thumb-keys/#comment-2117
** TODO Use trigraphs; try to make a layout with two rolls on one hand plus one key on the other. Do something like Carpalx.
** TODO Write a subroutine that automatically generates a .keylayout file for any platform.
** TODO Implement tab and thumb keys for the standard keyboard.
* Small Changes
** TODO In GTBRec(), if GTBBruteForce() runs, it could take a longer or shorter amount of time than everything else. Try to minimize downtime for multithreading.
** TODO Check to see which keys change between best layouts, and integrate that into smartMutate().
** TODO Instead of running GTB on the single best every time, run it on the best of the run with some probability.
** TODO Moving further along one hand costs more. For example, moving from a pinky to an index finger costs more than moving from a middle finger to an index finger.
** TODO Every movement from one finger to another has its own specific cost.
** TODO Create an option to not use shifted keys.
* Refactoring
** TODO Modify code to take advantage of C99.
** TODO Change initTypingData() to avoid repetition.
** TODO Make getCommands() less messy.
** TODO Run the program through Valgrind and clean it up.
** TODO Don't re-read typing data files or do other redundant tasks every time setksize() is called.
** TODO Inline common functions.
** TODO Use bools instead of ints where possible.
** TODO Make functions statis where possible.
** TODO For functions that don't modify Keyboard k, pass it in directly instead of passing a pointer.
** TODO "compare" doesn't return a helpful error message. You have to type "compare ". Similarly for all inputs that require one or more arguments.
* Bugs
** TODO compileTypingData() crashes.
*** Refactor layoutFromFile() to take a filename instead of a file; then, in error messages, print the filename along with the error.
** TODO GTBBF() sometimes duplicates a character. Re-enable it and fix bugs.
** TODO shortcutCosts only works for K_NO.
** TODO runAlgorithm() occasionally prints the same layout twice in a row.
* Miscellaneous 
** TODO Convert layouts in allLayouts.txt to full-layout form.
** TODO Get the Brown corpus and use it to produce frequencies.
